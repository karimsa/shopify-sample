# Shopify Application Submission - Summer 2017

Submission for the application to Shopify Developer Internship for the
Summer of 2017.

Requires: `node >= 6.x` (includes some ES6).

## Why the heck didn't I use Express, Bootstrap, React, Angular, etc.?

Anyone can use tools. Anyone can glue things together. It's the new definition
of a developer.

I think it's more powerful to be able to build the tools themselves. It's what I
love to do anyways. I wanted my submission to reflect this.

## Then why did you choose what you used?

 - **Google Fonts**: I love Open Sans. Plus, I think creating my own font for a
 single-page application for a job submission might be a bit overkill.
 - **Redux**: I used redux for queue-like state management. It's very lightweight,
 and it forced me to reduce things to simpler states.
 - **map-stream**: [@dominictarr](https://github.com/dominictarr) is just a complete
 streaming geniuos. I bow down to him.
 - **streamqueue**: Turning a stream into a queue is not a simple problem to solve.
 Although I've done it before, I remember what a headache it was. So I just plugged
 this brilliant thing in.
 - **next-port**: I wrote this a while ago to grab the next available port when you
 don't know the system very well.
